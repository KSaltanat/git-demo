I runaway, runaway
But I see you right under me, under me
The truth is all over me, over me
You cannot escape from me
Yea oh no, baby

I'm trying to run
I'm trying to hide
I'm trying to find a better place for me
Cause all I see
Is people crying over me, and over me
And I gotta take the blame
Gotta take on me baby
